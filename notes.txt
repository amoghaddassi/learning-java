Chapter 1: Java Overview
	1.1: Basic Program Structure
	- Java programs are collections of defintions (classes, functions, variables) which are grouped into classes.
	- Dot notation is used to access definitions that are part of an object.
	- In a method call, the function first evaluates the arguments in order, then calls the method on them.
	- Executing a complete program means running the main method; sometimes there is no main method.
	
	1.2: Compilation and Execution
	- Should put each class in a Java program in a seperate file <class-name>.java
	- Compile the program using javac program.java
	- Execute the program using java program
		- The argument to java is the name of the class with the main method.
	
	1.3: Simple Values and Expressions
	- Primitives: numbers, characters, booleans.
	- Standard numeric operations: *, +, -, /, %
		- Division by two integers is floor, while between two floats is exact.
	- Standard numeric comparisons (<, >, <=, >=, !=, ==) and boolean operators (and: &&, or: ||, not: !)
		- Precedence rules are often confusing so ok to use a lot of parantheses.
		- && and || are short circuiting operators in the same fashion as in python.
	- Strings:
		- Double quotes enclose all strings.
		- \n: newline, \t: tab
		- + operator works for concatenation, and will convert other types to strings.
	- Static Methods: A form abstraction:
		- Static methods: class methods
		- Non-static methods: instance methods
		- Difference is that only instance methods can use instance attributes.
		- Definition: A static T_r N (T_1 N_1, T_2 N_2, ...) {B}
			- A: public (can be called anywhere in the program), private (can be called anywhere in the class).
			- T_r: type of return value
			- N: method name
			- T_i, N_i: the type and name of the ith formal parameter.
			- ex. public static int add(int double, double val2) {return val1+val2;}
	
	1.4: Conditionals
	- if statements:
		if (condition) expression <else expression> where the else is optional
		- To do multiple things in a if statement, we can use block {} expressions, which can contain anynumber of expressions.
	- Condtional expressions: C ? if:else where C is some boolean expression, if and else are expressions.
	- Case analysis and the switch statement:
	Can use traditional if statement:
		if (condition) {}
		else if (condition) {}
		else
		- The difference between python elif and java else if is that there are two seperate if statements in the java version, whereas elif funcitonality is built into python.
	switch (variable) {
		case value: {}
		case value2: {}
		...
		default:
	
	1.5: Arrays from the command line
	- The main method takes in a array of strings (String[] args).
	- This means that if a java program is called like java Main "hi", args[0] will be bound to "hi".
	- We can index into args directly from the main method, so we can take user input into the program.
	- This can be referenced from the body of main, so we can create programs that take user input from the CLI
